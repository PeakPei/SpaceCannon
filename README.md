# How to Play:
* Click screen to shoot cannon
* Red Balls will destroy cannon balls or Shield if put into contact
* Shoot as many Red Balls as you can
* Don't shoot too much, you can have at most 5 cannon balls at a time and regenerate 1 every second
* Prevent the Red balls from reaching the blue line
* Listen to some deep house music
