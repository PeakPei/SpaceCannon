# How to Play:
* Click screen to shoot cannon
* Red Balls will destroy cannon balls or Shield if put into contact
* Shoot as many Red Balls as you can
* Don't shoot too much, you can have at most 5 cannon balls at a time and regenerate 1 every second
* Prevent the Red balls from reaching the blue line
* Red Balls with an X are score multipliers
* Balls with a star are bombs, hit them quickly
* Click on pause button at bottom right if the game gets too intense
* Listen to some deep house music, Paul Kalkbrenner's Azure is pretty great

Contrary to the 7MB gif above, the game does run smoothly

*To play just clone and Command-R in Xcode :)*
